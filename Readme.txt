This project just documents how the power query M language can be used to connect to a WEB API.
In this case the web api of https://www.awattar.de/services/api was connected to get a run chart that
shows how the german electricity rate develops over time. The queries can be used in Excel or in Power BI Desktop.

There are parameters for the start and endtime (also in Power BI) and one parameter to control the time-zone 
(and summer/winter time shifts).
